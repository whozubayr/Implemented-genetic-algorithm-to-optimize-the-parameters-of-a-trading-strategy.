Implemented genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of a trading strategy. The algorithm generated a population of chromosomes, which were sets of randomly initialized parameters for the trading strategy. It then evaluated the fitness of each chromosome by using machine learning to make trades with the parameters encoded in the chromosome and calculated the profitability of the trades.

The fittest chromosomes were then selected and bred to produce a new population of chromosomes. The process was repeated for a number of iterations, with a probability of mutation being applied to each chromosome at each iteration. In the end, the fittest chromosome returned as the solution.

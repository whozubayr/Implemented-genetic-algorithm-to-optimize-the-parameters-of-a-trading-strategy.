The goal of this process is to find the optimal set of parameters for a trading strategy that will maximize profitability. To do this, a genetic algorithm is implemented, which is a type of optimization algorithm that uses principles of natural evolution, such as selection, crossover, and mutation, to search for the optimal solution to a problem.

To begin, a population of chromosomes is generated. Each chromosome represents a set of parameters for the trading strategy, which are randomly initialized. The algorithm then evaluates the fitness of each chromosome by using machine learning to make trades with the parameters encoded in the chromosome and calculates the profitability of the trades. The fittest chromosomes, or those that resulted in the highest profitability, are selected and bred to produce a new population of chromosomes. This process is repeated for a number of iterations, with a probability of mutation being applied to each chromosome at each iteration. The mutation process involves randomly altering the values of certain parameters in a chromosome to introduce diversity into the population.

After the specified number of iterations has been reached, the fittest chromosome is returned as the solution. This chromosome encodes the optimal set of parameters for the trading strategy, as determined by the genetic algorithm. It is important to note that genetic algorithms can be computationally intensive and may require significant resources to run, and they may also be sensitive to the choice of parameters and initial population. It is important to carefully consider these factors to ensure the effectiveness of the algorithm.
